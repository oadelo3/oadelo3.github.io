- **Martin Defense Group, Portland, ME** <br />
  Autonomous Systems Scientist, Aug. 2021 - Present <br />
  - I work on a project funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) which seeks to implement the autonomous control of naval vessels. As part of this work, digital twin models of scaled-down naval shipboard power systems are modeled and simulated. Machine learning techniques are used as part of these digital twin models so that the digital twin’s simulated waveforms show more agreement with the experiment’s waveforms.  
  - I am the principal investigator for a project funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) which seeks to implement fault recognition strategies in space habitats. As part of this project, a mock space habitat was built consisting of a thermal control system and grey water filtering system.

- **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA** <br />
  Research Assistant, Sep. 2017-Aug. 2021.  MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Energy Systems Group (47) <br />
  - I worked on a variety of projects, usually funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) related to tactical microgrids for the U.S military throughout my four years as a PhD student.  I modeled the operation of hybrid microgrids (diesel gensets and renewable energy-based generation) and investigated methods for system identification for devices within such microgrids. Also, I worked with a power hardware in the loop (PHiL) set-up which allowed a programmable power amplifier to emulate a diesel generator (or any arbitrary generation device). Also, I utilized a supercomputing platform to perform parallelized time-domain simulations and implement parallel algorithms for system identification.

- **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA** <br />
  Teaching Assistant, Sep. 2016-May 2017.  MIT Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) <br />
  - I was a teaching assistant for a sophomore-level electrical engineering class “Signals and Systems.” I led small group sessions, helped with the course’s administrative work, held office hours, answered questions in the class’s online forum, and typed homework assignments, homework solutions, exams, and exam solutions in LaTeX.

- **Oracle Corporation, Burlington, MA** <br />
  Hardware Engineer, Jul. 2013-Jul. 2016.  Advanced Archive Development Group <br />
  - I worked in a group which was developing a prototype for an optical tape storage drive. The storage medium was flexible tape (because of its high bits/area storage density), and the cartridges were to be used for cold storage for large quantities of data. In my role, I helped with the modeling, simulation, design, and testing of different circuits on the printed circuit boards in the system (1 “mother” board, and 1 “daughter” board). Some of the key functionality implemented in circuits on the boards included signal processing, the control of H-bridge amplifiers for actuation, and the selection of appropriate components used to provide adequate power on the boards. <br />

- **Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), Delft, The Netherlands** <br />
  Research Assistant, Jan. 2013.  TU Delft Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Jacob Caro <br />
  - For one month, I helped assemble an experimental apparatus used for Raman Spectroscopy experiments.
