Hello and welcome to my personal web page!  I am a dentist and public health professional working in central Maine.  I administer dental care to patients, create effective treatment plans, and help shape the direction of the dental clinic at Health Access Network (HAN).  I am especially interested in helping disadvantaged, needy patient populations in need.  On this page, you will find some more information about my work.  On the left, there are links to other web pages with more information.  There is my relevant work experience, a photo gallery, and my resume.  Please reach out via email (oadelo3@gmail.com) if you would like to talk more!
